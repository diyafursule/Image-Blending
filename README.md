### Introduction
- Image blending is a technique used to combine two images into a single image.
- The goal of image blending is to create a seamless image that looks like a single image. 
- This is done by blending the two images together in such a way that the transition between the two images is not visible. 
- Image blending is used in many applications such as image editing, panorama stitching, and image compositing.
- In this project, we will implement image blending using multiple algorithms.

### Image Blending Algorithms
1. Cut and Paste Blending
2. Alpha Blending
3. MultiBand Blending
4. Poisson Blending
5. Gradient Domain Blending

### Structure of the Project
The project is divided into the following directories:
1. Images - Contains the input images for the project
2. Results - Contains the output images generated by the algorithms
3. Code - Contains the code for the project

### How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the code directory
3. In the ipynb file, run the libraries and utility functions.
4. Run the algorithms. 
5. Now load the images and mask using `load_images` function.
6. Run the `Run_Additive_Blend` function to get results at different `alpha` in additive weighted blending.
7. Run the `Run_All_Models` function to run all the models at once.
8. The output images will be visible

### Code Overview
#### Models (Algorithms)
1. `Cut_Paste_Blend` - This algorithm blends two images by cutting a region from one image and pasting it into another image.
2. `Alpha_Blend` - This algorithm blends two images by combining the pixel values of the two images using a weighted sum.
3. `MultiBandBlending` - This algorithm blends two images by decomposing the images into multiple frequency bands and blending the bands separately.
4. `PoissonBlend` - This algorithm blends two images by solving a Poisson equation to find the optimal pixel values for the blended image.
5. `GradientDomainBlending` - This algorithm blends two images by solving a Poisson equation in the gradient domain to find the optimal pixel values for the blended image.
6. `AdditiveWeightedBlending` - This algorithm blends two images using additive weighted blending where weights can be altered in mask.

#### Utility functions
1. `choose_image` - Allows you to choose any image for blending.
2. `draw_mask` - Allows you to draw mask aroud the object in image that you want to blend.
3. `load_images` - This combine the features of both choose_image and draw_mask directly so that you have to run only that function once.
4. `show images` - Takes list of images, list of titles corresponding to images, rows, columns and figsize to show images.  
5. `Run_Additive_Blend` - Allows you to get results of additive weighted blending at different alphas.
6. `Run_All_Models` - Allows you to get results of all rest all models.
